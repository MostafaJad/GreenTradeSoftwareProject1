# GreenTradeSoftwareProject1
Project GreenTrade is a program that acts as a middleman providing recyclables from consumers back to producers. 
The company picks up consumer’s recyclables and sells them to buyers, sharing a percentage of the profit back to its users to promote recycling and reducing their ecological footprint.
Project GreenTrade is a mobile application that allows users to trade in their recyclables for points which can be redeemed for monetary rewards or products. Instead of simply recycling using the city’s recycling program, our product rewards the user for actively recycling with us. As a result, the intended effect is to promote users to be more conscious about the products they are consuming (non-recyclable containers/wrappers vs. recyclable ones), as well as to promote recycling where the item may have been trashed in the past.
The benefits of the project is intended to be two-fold. On one hand, our customers are not only reducing their ecological footprint and being more green-conscious, but also earn some money (or save money trading in points for products) on the side. On the other hand, it can promote companies to reduce the use of single-use plastics and look towards recyclable items to contain their products. At the same time, the company as a whole benefits as a middle-man selling recyclables from the consumer back to the producers.
The project will be deemed successful if it can:
Gain a steady and growing user base to use the application on a weekly or monthly basis
Turn a profit from reselling the recyclables while providing monetary rewards to the end user
